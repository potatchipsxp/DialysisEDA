# DialysisEDA

This repo contain an analysis of dialysis clinincs and their surrounding regional demographics.

The dialysis clininc data was obtained from
data from https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/59mq-zhts and https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/23ew-n7w9

The Country economic and eduaction data were obtianed here
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/

How to use:
All data has already been wrangled, but if one so desires they can wrangle the data again by using the wrangler.r script.
With the wrangled data one can go directly to the analysis code which will explore the data and show a few preliminary findings
Addiitonally to go straight to the goods, one can read the paper by opening EDA.html in their browser, or if one wants to genreate the paper themselves they can open EDA.rmd in R studio.

Hope you find this helpful.
